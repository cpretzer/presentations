? deploy nginx-ingress-controller configmap
- This was not necessary because the ingress controller deployed by helm included the relevant `data` sections
Edit cm/nginx-ingress-controller because the --configmap argument had a value of ev-nginx-ingress-controller and
the configmap was named nginx-ingress-controller
Add annotation to emoji namespace
    config.linkerd.io/trace-collector: "oc-collector.tracing:55678"
Add env to web, emoji, and voting deployments
        - name: OC_AGENT_HOST
          value: "oc-collector.tracing:55678"
Update all deployments to use `v8-tracing` tracing
* Make sure that the open tracing components are injected with linkerd
